# odin-recipes

This project will create a website of recipe webpages

In this project I will:

- Setup a repo on github
- Clone repo locally using git
- Use html to create the index webpage (setup html boilerplate)
- Add nav anchors to recipe webpages
- Add images using img tag
- Setup body using semantic tags (header, section, 
  footer)
- Organize file system in a comprehensive way
- Create html webpages for each recipe
- Stage and commit changes with good commit messages to the
  repo on GitHub at each milestone
